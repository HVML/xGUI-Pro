FindNcurses
--------------

Find Ncurses headers and libraries.

Imported Targets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``Ncurses::Ncurses``
  The Ncurses library, if found.

Result Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This will define the following variables in your project:

``Ncurses_FOUND``
  true if (the requested version of) Ncurses is available.
``Ncurses_VERSION``
  the version of Ncurses.
``Ncurses_LIBRARIES``
  the libraries to link against to use Ncurses.
``Ncurses_INCLUDE_DIRS``
  where to find the Ncurses headers.
``Ncurses_COMPILE_OPTIONS``
  this should be passed to target_compile_options(), if the
  target is not used for linking

#]=======================================================================]

# TODO: Remove when cmake_minimum_version bumped to 3.14.
